I haven't really thought about the use of this blog ever since I programmed it. It was more of an excuse to learn how to use Jekyll to be honest. But now, it seems to be a good idea to have a semi-private place on the web where I can put my thoughts in and maybe revisit after some time.

<!---excerpt--> 

I've spent months and months reading some brilliant [essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) [by](http://idlewords.com/2004/05/attacked_by_thugs.htm) [others](http://jackcheng.com/habit-fields) [on](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/opinion/sunday/ashes-to-ashes-but-first-a-nice-pine-box.html) [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and it's about time I try it out myself. Let's begin.

[MHacks IV](http://mhacks.org/) was probably the best hackathon I've been to so far. The events and camaraderie made it feel more like a weekend vacation instead of what I thought was a serious hackathon, and I've met a lot of friendly and inspirational people there. For instance, it turns out that one of the New Yorkers attending MHacks IV with me was [Dani Grant](http://www.thedanigrant.com/)&#8212;the person behind [HACKERS OF NY](http://hackersofny.com/). What made this such a crazy coincidence was that when I made [stuyscioly.github.io](http://stuyscioly.github.io/), I had no idea how to code with HTML, CSS, and JS so I saved Hackers of NY's HTML code and added my own twist to create Stuyvesant Science Olympiad's page. Never would I have thought that I'd meet the person who made the website I was ripping off of.
