On the day after I got home from [BattleHacks Boston](https://2014.battlehack.org/boston) where we built [Lineless](http://devchuk.github.io/portfolio/software/lineless.html), my friend Yaseen asked me if I happened to be free for the rest of the week.
<br><br>
It turns out that the company he interned in, [Kite & Rocket](http://kiteandrocket.com/), needed some help designing & building a balloon carriage to launch a phone up in midtown Manhattan. The goal was to broadcast a [livestream](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/kite-and-rocket) running from the phone's camera by the end of this week. What's even more ridiculous about this thing is that I would actually be paid for this. So I said something alone the lines of "..yes of course" and the project started right away on the same day.
<br><br>
For the project, we used:

>		cable ties
>		ribbons
>		a hydrogen tank
>		6 foil balloons
>		a couple book/binder rings
>		a Verizon Wireless Prepaid Motorola Moto G No-Contract Cell Phone
>		a 500 MB data plan with unlimited texting and stuff I don't remember
>		a 3D printer & CAD software

<br><br>
So once I bought the phone, I measured its dimensions and began to design the case with Solidworks CAD software. It was made in two parts that are mirror images of each other.
<br>

<br>
The case features holes for the lock button, the volume buttons, the charger port, and the microphone hole. Basically, you were able to use the phone normally with the case on. Also, the case had a roll cage that would cause the phone to roll onto its side no matter what happens, thus enabling us to capture footage once it <del>crashed</del> landed. The roll cage also doubled as an attachment point for balloon ribbons and any ballasts we needed. I decided to add as many holes as possible so we could choose what angle we wanted the phone to be set at for the camera angle.

<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the Makerbot 3D printer stopped printing the first half of the case due to an SD card error, but only the very middle hole of the arc roll cages was unusable. We didn't plan to use it anyways because we wanted the phone to aim at around a 45 degree angle instead of straight down.

<br>
<br>
I continued by printing with the second half of the case and assembled the case using cable ties with the phone inside. Then I looped binder rings onto both sides of the device and tied three balloons to each binder ring. This way we're able to remove the binder rings and safely carry the balloons seperately from the case in case of any sharp obstactles. More cable ties were used to secure the balloons to the binder rings.

<br>
<br>
We didn't want the balloon camera to just fly straight up and get above the NYC skyscrapers. Instead we wanted it to slowly crawl up in order to see people's dumbfounded faces. Thus, I used a lathe to carve a "unicorn horn" out of ABS and glued it to the top of the case. Washers were stacked around the unicorn horn in order to weigh it down. In the end, the weight of the apparatus was so neutral that it would just stay at exactly the same level, only changing in position by my mere breathing.

As of the creation of this page, the launch time is within 15 hours. I will post a video of its flight later.
