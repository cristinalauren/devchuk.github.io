At late September, I received an email from [Kite & Rocket](http://kiteandrocket.com/) telling me that the company was working on a [balloon launch](http://devchuk.github.io/portfolio/miscellaneous/balloon.html) for a [mini-maker faire](http://makerfaire.com/) in Providence, Rhode Island. They needed my help to set up the launch and gather materials to build another Balloon Phone.

When I came in, it turns out that they changed their minds about the balloon launch. Instead of having balloons lift up a camera, they wanted to have balloons lift up a <b>glider containing the camera</b>. The idea was that after the balloons reach a certain altitude, a releasing mechanism would let go of the glider and have it gracefully fly away&mdash;all while transmitting a livestream to a large screen down on the ground. I had no idea how to build it, but I decided to take on the job anyways. Let's look at the materials we need. I grouped them in 

Electrical:
>		electrical prototyping tools (breadboards, jumper cables, common sense, etc.)
>		Arduino Mini with ATMega328
>		abutton press switch
>		VN2222 n-channel FET
>		USB2Serial MicroUSB Arduino Mini connector
>		a9V battery
>		a solenoid
>		a protoboard
>		soldering tools, skills, and a steady hand


Mechanical:
>		cable ties
>		ribbons
>		a helium tank
>		lots and lots of foil balloons
>		a Verizon Wireless Prepaid Motorola Moto G No-Contract Cell Phone
>		a 500 MB data plan with unlimited texting and stuff I still don't remember
>		a 3D printer & CAD software
>		some sort of apparatus hook onto the releasing mechanism
>		a glider
>		decent knowledge on flying mechanics

The releasing mechanism was first built. The way it works it pretty simple. You turn it on. You press the countdown button. And then you release the balloon. After a specific time the releasing mechanism would release the balloon.
