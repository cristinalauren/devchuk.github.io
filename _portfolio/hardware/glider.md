At late September, I received an email from [Kite & Rocket](http://kiteandrocket.com/) telling me that the company was working on a [balloon launch](http://devchuk.github.io/portfolio/miscellaneous/balloon.html) for a [mini-maker faire](http://makerfaire.com/) in Providence, Rhode Island. They needed my help to set up the launch and gather materials to build another Balloon Phone.

When I came in, it turns out that they changed their minds about the balloon launch. Instead of having balloons lift up a camera, they wanted to have balloons lift up a <b>glider containing the camera</b>. The idea was that after the balloons reach a certain altitude, a releasing mechanism would let go of the glider and have it gracefully fly away&mdash;all while transmitting a livestream to a large screen down on the ground. I wasn't too sure how the glider would fly, but I decided to take on the job. Let's look at the materials we need.
